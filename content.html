              My Story...
              I grew up loving the human body and everything about the world of medcial sciences
              I grew up loving the human body and everything about the world of medical sciences.
              But, when the enception of the  <em>Covid-19 Panemic</em>, I was exposed to loss of life like I've never witnessed before, and it took a huge toll on
              my mental health. I knew I needed <strong> drastic change </strong>. So, I did what any normal person would do and withdraw from Medical School... In order to find a career that would be ever evolving
              like clinical medicine. With that in mind, I found <strong> Web developement </strong>. The intricicies of code,
              and the dynamic input you can add to pages made me feel as though I was learning about a whole new life form
              and once more gave me the drive medicine did. The life of code is amazing, and I hope to share my work with you!
